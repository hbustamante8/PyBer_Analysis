# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is analyze data for PyBer, a python based ride sharing app company. With the use of jupyter notebook, pandas, and matplotlib libraries, a multiple -line graph is created to demonstrate the total weekly fares for each city type. There are three city types within the two large data sets captured, which are Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This graph will be used along with recommendations to equip PyBer's CEO to address the disparities uncovered from the analysis.



## Results


Using jupyter notebook and the pandas library, a summary dataframe was created that show the metrics between the three city types. Urban had the most total number of rides by a huge margin. Rural data revealed that there were only 125 rides compared to Urban's 1,625. It is important to note that while rural had the least number of total rides, they also had the least amount of drivers. Urban also had the most number of total drivers while Suburban came in second place for both of these categories. The average fare per ride was the highest for Rural rides with suburban coming in second place. The average fare per driver in the summary revealed that urban was the lowest for that metric. Rural has the highest average fare per driver while again suburban came in second. Finally, 'Total Fares', were highest for urban rides followed by suburban and lastly rural. The most revenue for Pyber therefore, comes from Urban rides.

The data frame visual below is a summary of the key metrics between the different city types.

## Summary

Below are some recommnedations that should be taken into consideration so that PyBer can continue to enhance their revenue and provide the most value to riders in all city types.

### Recommendations

The first recommendation  is to increase the amount of drivers in the rural cities. The low amount of drivers is casusing the average fare per ride is high which seems to push riders away. Riders have alternative services such as other ridesharing apps, taxis, public transport, etc. To get the most out of rural rides, there should be a campaign or focus to bring in new drivers to that area. Especially since the average far per dirver is high compared to the other city types.

Secondly, suburban drivers should be increased as well. From the urban city type metrics, it can be intepreted that the total drivers exceed the total amount of rides and has led a lot of money brought in. Therefore, there should also be a target to get more drivers in the suburban city to help drive down the price a bit as well as the average fare per driver. Suburban rides are not being reached to their full potential and total fares would drive up if there more drivers to meet the needs of riders.

Lastly, for urban city type, there should be an increase in the price of the ride by a small margin. The average fare per dirver is very low and overtime or in the near future may become unfavorable for the drivers. This will cause them to drive for other ridesharing services who provide a more favorable percentage rate for a driver in the same area.

### Final remarks

PyBer should take in consideration these recommendations to move the company forward and succesful in the area they operate in. The ridesharing industry is very competive and there must be constant adatptation based on what current data portrays. Using this analysis and implementing the recommnedations will serve to benefit PyBer and all its stakeholders.
