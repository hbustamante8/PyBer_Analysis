# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is analyze data for PyBer, a python based ride sharing app company. With the use of jupyter notebook, pandas, and matplotlib libraries, a multiple -line graph is created to demonstrate the total weekly fares for each city type. There are three city types within the two large data are Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This graph will be used along with recommendations on how PyBer's CEO can move forward by addressing the disparities uncovered.



## Results


Using jupyter notebook and the pandas library, a summary dataframe was created that show the metrics between the three city types. Urban had the most total number of rides by a huge margin. Rural data revealed tha there were only 125 rides compared to Urban's 1,625. It is important to not that while rural had the least number of total rides, they also had the least amount of drivers. Urban also had the most number of total drivers while Suburban came in second place for both of these categories. The average fare per ride was the highest for Rural rides with suburban coming in second place. The average fare per driver in the summary revealed that urban was the lowest for that metric. Rural has the highest average fare per driver while again suburban came in second.  Do I want to talk about 'Total Fares' ???
The data frame visual below is a summary of the key metrics between the different city types.
