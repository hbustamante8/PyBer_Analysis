# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze data for PyBer, a python-based ride sharing app company. With the use of Jupyter notebook, Pandas, and matplotlib libraries, a multiple -line graph is created to demonstrate the total weekly fares for each city type. There are three city types within the two large data sets captured, which are Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This graph will be used along with recommendations to equip PyBer's CEO to address the disparities uncovered from the analysis.



## Results


### Summary Data Frame results
Using Jupyter notebook and the Pandas library, a summary data frame was created that shows the metrics between the three city types. Urban rides had the most total number of rides by a huge margin. Rural metrics revealed that there were only 125 rides compared to Urban's 1,625. It is important to note that while Rural had the least number of total rides, they also had the least number of drivers. Urban rides also had the greatest number of total drivers while Suburban came in second place for both categories. The average fare per ride was the highest for Rural rides with Suburban coming in second place. The average fare per driver highlighted hat Urban was the lowest for that metric. Rural has the highest average fare per driver while again Suburban came in second. Finally, 'Total Fares', were highest for Urban rides followed by Suburban and lastly Rural. The most revenue for Pyber therefore comes from Urban rides according to all the data available.

The data frame visual below is a summary of the key metrics between the different city types.

### Graph results

The graph portrays a similar story to the summary data frame. Urban rides bring in the most total number of fares consistently. Meanwhile, Rural brings in the lowest number of total fares on a consistent basis. Interestingly, all three city types had a high total number of fares for the third week of February. Finally, Suburban rides had the biggest increase from the start of January to end of April compared to the other city types. Rides in Suburban seem to be on a trend to increase after April. Thus, a solid city type to build on for the number of rides to get closer to Urban total fares.
Below is an image the graph that shows the total fare by city type from January to the end of April.

## Summary

Below are some recommendations that should be taken into consideration so that PyBer can continue to enhance their revenue and provide the most value to riders in all the city types they operate in.

### Recommendations

The first recommendation is to increase the number of drivers in the rural cities. The low number of drivers is causing the average fare per ride to be high which seems to push riders away. Riders have alternative services such as other ridesharing apps, taxis, public transport, etc. To get the most out of rural rides, there should be a campaign or focus to bring in new drivers to that area. Especially since the average far per driver is high compared to the other city types Pyber operates in.

Secondly, suburban drivers should be increased as well. From the urban city type metrics, it can be interpreted that the total drivers exceed the total amount of rides and has led a lot of revenue to come in. Therefore, there should also be a target to get more drivers in the suburban city to help drive down the price a bit as well for the average fare per driver. Suburban rides are not being reached to their full potential and total fares would drive up if there were more drivers to meet the needs of riders.

Lastly, for urban city type, there should be an increase in the price of the ride by a small margin. The average fare per driver is very low and overtime or in the near future may become unfavorable for the drivers. This will cause them to drive for other ridesharing services who provide a more favorable percentage rate for a driver in the same area. For that to happen, there must be a slight increase in the average fare per ride which would results in more money left for the driver. Or alternatively, reducing the number of drivers in the urban area would also allow for the average fare per driver to increase. Both options work but must be implemented gradually and monitored closely as Urban rides bring in the most revenue.

### Final remarks

PyBer should take into consideration these recommendations to move the company forward and reach maximum success in the areas they operate in. The ridesharing industry is very competitive and there must be constant adaptation based on what current data portrays. Using this analysis and implementing the recommendations will serve to benefit PyBer, stakeholders, and customers.
